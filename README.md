# A Shades clone in Haskell with SpriteKit

Shades is a sample game for the [Haskell SpriteKit binding](https://github.com/mchakravarty/HaskellSpriteKit). It also serves as a running example in the paper [Haskell SpriteKit â€” Transforming an Imperative Object-oriented API into a Purely Functional One](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CK17.html).
